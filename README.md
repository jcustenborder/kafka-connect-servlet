# Introduction

This connector is designed to make the implementation of [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) style connectors much easier to implement.
This works by embedding [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) and registering a [Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Servlets) 
module with your web service implementations. All of the other things you would need to do this securely are handled by 
the base task including SSL configuration.

# Getting Started. 

Building your own connector to receive [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) events is pretty easy. The following sections are 
all that are needed to implement your [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook).

## Inheriting from BaseWebHookTask

```java
public class MockWebHookTask extends BaseWebHookTask<MockWebHookConnectorConfig> {
  @Override
  protected MockWebHookConnectorConfig config(Map<String, String> settings) {
    return new MockWebHookConnectorConfig(settings);
  }

  @Override
  protected ServletModule servletModule() {
    return new ServletModule() {
      @Override
      protected void configureServlets() {
        serve("/test").with(TestServlet.class);
      }
    };
  }
}
```

## Implementing your servlet

In the example below `SourceRecordConcurrentLinkedDeque records` is injected by Guice. `BaseWebHookTask` creates an 
instance of a `SourceRecordConcurrentLinkedDeque` and binds it globally. This allows your service to create SourceRecord(s)
that returned when the framework calls `poll()` on `BaseWebHookTask`.

```java
@Singleton
class TestServlet extends HttpServlet {

  @Inject
  SourceRecordConcurrentLinkedDeque records;

  @Override
  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
    try (PrintWriter writer = resp.getWriter()) {
      writer.print("OK");
    }
    resp.setStatus(200);

    Map<String, ?> sourceOffset = ImmutableMap.of();
    Map<String, ?> sourcePartition = ImmutableMap.of();

    records.add(
        new SourceRecord(
            sourcePartition,
            sourceOffset,
            "test",
            null,
            Schema.STRING_SCHEMA,
            "test",
            Schema.STRING_SCHEMA,
            "test"
        )
    );
  }
}
```

## Configuration 

`BaseWebHookConnectorConfig` is the class your configurations should inherit from. This provides
all of the base functionality for SSL and things like health checks.
